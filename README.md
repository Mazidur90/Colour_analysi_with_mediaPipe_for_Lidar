# problem :  At a appliannce manufacturer company, they want to develop their add on instrument for person detection in a drone , they want to make a hands free operation for the mounted camera and asks the technical intern to find a solution for this problem.
# Technical-Intern( Me ): I will make a python aplication for you that will work on the gesture of hands in order to performn various operations. Just give me the input parameters that you want to like to use, example : hansa, eye iris, head_nodding or even by your droziness level( like if it fins your face expressions like --too much humming, eye closed for longer time it will ask you if you are okay to continue or not!

This scrpit is done for pysically challenged people here in this script i have demonstrated a hands-free control system that could be used in various applications such as media player controls, presentations, or any interactive system needing gesture-based input, showcasing both computer vision and automation capabilities.
